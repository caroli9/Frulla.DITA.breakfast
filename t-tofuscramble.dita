        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Pat tofu dry and roll in a clean, absorbent towel with something heavy on top, such as a cast iron skillet, for 15 minutes.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step >
                <cmd>While tofu is draining, prepare sauce by adding dry spices to a small bowl and adding enough water to make a pourable sauce. Set aside.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Prep veggies and warm a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp olive oil and the onion and red pepper. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook until softened - about 5 minutes.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Add kale, season with a bit more salt and pepper, and cover to steam for 2 minutes.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>In the meantime, unwrap tofu and use a fork to crumble into bite-sized pieces.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Use a spatula to move the veggies to one side of the pan and add tofu. Saut√© for 2 minutes, then add sauce, pouring it mostly over the tofu and a little over the veggies. Stir immediately, evenly distributing the sauce. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until tofu is slightly browned.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>
                    Serve immediately with the breakfast potatoes, toast or fruit. I like to add more flavor with salsa, hot sauce and/or fresh cilantro. Serves 2.</cmd>
